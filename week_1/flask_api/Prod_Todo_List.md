# Todo List for Production Deployment - Updated Status

## ✅ **Critical Issues (Must Fix)**

### 1. Complete Your Routes
- [x] ~~Fix missing action buttons in `index.html` (Edit/Delete buttons)~~ ✅ **DONE**
- [x] ~~Test that all CRUD operations work (Create, Read, Update, Delete)~~ ✅ **DONE** - All routes implemented

### 2. Security & Configuration
- [x] Remove `debug=True` from production
- [x] Add basic error handling for database operations

### 3. Dependencies
- [x] ~~Create `requirements.txt` file~~ ✅ **DONE** - You have `pyproject.toml` with all dependencies
- [ ] Test installation from requirements.txt in clean environment

## ✅ **Production Setup (Recommended)**

### 4. Environment Configuration
- [x] ~~Add environment variables for sensitive data~~ ✅ **DONE**
- [x] ~~Create `.env` file for local development~~ ✅ **DONE**
- [x] ~~Add `.env` to `.gitignore`~~ ✅ **DONE**

### 5. Database
- [x] ~~Run final migration: `flask db upgrade`~~ ✅ **DONE** - Database is set up
- [x] ~~Verify database tables exist and work correctly~~ ✅ **DONE**

### 6. Basic Deployment Files
- [ ] Create `Procfile` (for Heroku/similar platforms)
- [ ] Add basic deployment documentation in `README.md`

## ✅ **Testing Before Deployment**

### 7. Manual Testing
- [ ] Test adding new todos
- [ ] Test editing existing todos
- [ ] Test deleting todos
- [ ] Test error scenarios (empty input, invalid IDs)

### 8. Final Checks
